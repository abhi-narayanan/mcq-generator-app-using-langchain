       "{'text': \"A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions\\nautomatically.A robot can be guided by an external control\\ndevice, or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be\\nconstructed to evoke human form, but most robots are taskperforming machines, designed with an emphasis on stark\\nfunctionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.\\nRobots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range\\nfrom humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative\\nMobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot\\n(TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient\\nassist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed\\nswarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1\\nPredator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a\\nlifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may\\nconvey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.\\nAutonomous things are expected to proliferate in the future,\\nwith home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the\\nmain drivers.\\nThe branch of technology that deals with the design,\\nconstruction, operation, and application of robots, as well as\\ncomputer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and\\ninformation processing is robotics. These technologies deal\\nwith automated machines that can take the place of humans in\\ndangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or\\nresemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many\\nof today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field\\nof bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.\\nFrom the time of ancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable\\nautomated devices and even automata resembling humans and other animals, such as\\nanimatronics, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through\\nthe Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines,\\nremote-control and wireless remote-control.\\nThe term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot'\\nwas first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi\\nUniverzální Roboti – Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother\\nJosef Čapek who was the word's true inventor. Electronics evolved into the driving force of\\ndevelopment with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey\\nWalter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in\\nthe late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen.\\nThe first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built\\nby George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was\\nsold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces\\nof hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher\\nGuide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township,\\nNew Jersey.\\nRobots have replaced humans\\nin performing repetitive and\\ndangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable\\nto do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme\\nenvironments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea.\\nThere are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their\\nrole in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological\\nunemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers\\nof functions. The use of robots in military combat raises\\nethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and\\npotential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may\\nbe a realistic concern in the future\",\n",
